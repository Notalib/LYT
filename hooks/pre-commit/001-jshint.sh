# This pre-commit hooks checks for changed or new JavaScript files
# in the commit and tries to validated them with jshint.
# If any staged file doesn't validate, you don't get to commit the file.
#
# Only three things are required for this script:
# - JSHint must be installed as a commandline tool.
# - the file jshint.conf must exist at the base of the git repository,
#    it contains a JSON with the config parameters for node.js scripts.
# - the file jshint_browser.conf must also exist, this is the same as 
#    the jshint.conf just for the browser. It'll be used on files in
#    the path "public/javascripts", all other files will be validated
#    with the jshint.conf.
